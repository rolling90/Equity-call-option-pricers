Equity call options pricers: 

I have created one pricer that uses the black scholes model approach and another that uses a monte carlo simulation approach.

Prices from each can be used to validate each other

## About Me
I have 20 years of experience in finance:

- 10 years in derivatives sales and structuring at Barclays Capital, Lloyds Banking Group, and Cr√©dit Agricole CIB, where I became a derivatives structuring desk head and Deputy Chief Dealer, generating $26.5m in desk PnL and $15m in individual PnL in top year.
- 10 years in non-front office roles, including at J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley, including in Risk and exotic rates derivatves valuations control.

I am now upgrading my programming and quantitative skills with the goal of securing a quantitative or quant-related role in a hedge fund or investment bank.
